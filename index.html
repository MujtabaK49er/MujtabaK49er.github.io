            <h2>About Me</h2>
            
            <p>My name is Mujtaba Ali Khan, a junior at UNC Charlotte. Since elementary school, I have been passionate about arts and crafts, enjoying them as both a hobby and a creative outlet. Over the years, making things by hand has become a way for me to express my ideas visually. In addition to arts and crafts, I also enjoy Basketball and baking.</p>
            <h3>My Backgound in Arts and Craft:</h3>
            <p> Since elementary school, I have dedicated myself to arts and crafts. My love for creating first emerged in 6th grade, and since then, I have explored a variety of crafts. In addition to drawing, painting, and paper crafts like origami and card crafting, I enjoy creating elaborate designs that showcase cultural artistry, speacially from my home country Saudi Arabia. I also take part in DIY activities such as modeling clay and repurposing objects into new decorations. More than just a hobby, arts and crafts provide me with relaxation, a creative outlet, and continuous learning with every project I take on.</p>
