            <h2>About Me</h2>
            
            <p>My name is Mujtaba Ali Khan, a junior at UNC Charlotte. Since elementary school, I have been passionate about exploring different parts of the world, finding joy in discovering new places, cultures, and experiences. Traveling has not only broadened my perspective but also allowed me to embrace diverse traditions and landscapes. Over the years, this passion has fueled my curiosity, leading me to continuously learn and grow. In addition to traveling, I enjoy outdoor activities that keep me active and engaged with my surroundings. I also enjoy Basketball and baking.</p>
            <h3>My Backgound in Arts and Craft:</h3>
            <p> Since elementary school, I have been passionate about exploring different places, outdoor sports, and baking. My love for adventure and discovering new surroundings first emerged in sixth grade, and since then, I have sought opportunities to travel and engage in various outdoor activities. Whether hiking through nature, playing sports, or experiencing new cultures, I find joy in staying active and expanding my horizons. Additionally, baking has become a creative outlet for me, allowing me to experiment with flavors and techniques. More than just hobbies, these interests provide me with relaxation, personal growth, and a deeper appreciation for the world around me.</p>
