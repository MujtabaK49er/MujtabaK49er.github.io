                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>I am Mujtaba Ali Khan, a junior at UNCC concentrating in Data Science. I am an adventurous explorer who loves stepping beyond everyday routines to discover new places, cultures, and experiences. Traveling to unfamiliar destinations, observing nature, and embracing different perspectives bring me joy and fulfillment. Through my journeys, I gain knowledge, broaden my understanding, and develop a deeper appreciation for the diversity and beauty of the world. Whether through travel, outdoor adventures, or simply observing my surroundings, I find excitement in learning, growing, and connecting with the world in meaningful ways.</p>
                <h3> My background </h3>
                 <p>I am an international student here, ethnically from India but born and raised in Saudi Arabia. Since I was young, my parents always made it a point to travel to different cities and countries whenever they had a vacation. Growing up in such an environment, I developed a deep sense of curiosity and a love for exploring new places and cultures. These experiences shaped my perspective on the world and fueled my desire to continue discovering the beauty and diversity around me</p>
